\section{Introduction}

For many developers who have primarily worked with interpreted languages such as
Python or JavaScript in the past, learning C++ may seem like a daunting task at
first: There're many moving parts between your \path{hello_world.cpp} and final
executable that you can't simply ignore, especially if you're keen on developing
cross-platform programs or want to collaborate with developers who use a different
operating system. In this document you will learn what is happening behind the scenes
when you build a C++ project. After reading this text you should be able to explain
the build process more precisely without going into implementation details. It also
serves as a starting point in case you want to learn more about compilers.

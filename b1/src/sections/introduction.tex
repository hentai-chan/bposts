\section{Introduction}

When it comes to literature, a common distinction is made between three major 
forms that are of great interest, namely poetry, prose and drama. By way of 
an introduction, we are going to take a look at the terminology below to help 
us set the stage for the upcoming discussion. What follows is a brief breakdown 
of a selection of books that changed the world of literature forever. Originally
intended to serve as an introduction to an essay that explores past and future 
of Japanese Light Novels, the books mentioned here encouraged me to go a little 
more into depth about the authors responsible for the early English novels. This
will prove important later when we embark on an adventure through the world of 
Light Novels in search of distinct characteristics and influences.
